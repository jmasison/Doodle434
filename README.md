# Doodle434

Running this app is fairly straightforward. To run, simply hit run in android studio and choose the emulator you wish to use. Once the app is loaded the user is presented with the main screen. From here, the user can use his/her finger as a stylus and draw by touching the screen. The user has an option to clear the current view and change color/opacity/size. The current color/opacity/size settings are maintained until the user changes one, and any changes are independent of the other characteristics of the stylus. The custom feature that I choose to implement was saving to the gallery. The user can at any point click the menu button and from the drop down list choose save to save. The image that is saved is the current state and changes before or after are not reflected in the saved gallery image.
